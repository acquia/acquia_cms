      value: "<p>Mary Rosenthal, James King and Tina Singh took first, second and third place respectively in Acquiaville's&nbsp;first ever cross-borough bike race. The race began in Center City and continued for 50 miles. All three winners took the lead within the first 10 miles and were able to successfully maintain it for the remainder of the race.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about their process for training, Rosenthal explained that the most important aspect was getting used to being in the bike saddle for long durations of time. King and Singh agreed, explaining that despite being avid cyclers, their muscles had to be trained to ensure they could continue for longer. All three explained that they began training for the race three months in advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initiative to launch Acquiaville's first cross-borough bike race came from a&nbsp;City Council program to help encourage exercise across the city's residents. This is one of many initiatives that will take place as the season progresses, and will include participants from various age groups.</p>\r\n"
