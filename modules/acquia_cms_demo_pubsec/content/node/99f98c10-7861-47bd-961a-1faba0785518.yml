      value: "<p>Paula Mendez joined the Acquiaville City Council in 2014 as the representative for District 5, after a decade of public service. She moved to Acquiaville as a child and has lived here ever since.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A City Council Member, Paula has focused much of her efforts towards expanding tenants rights, senior citizen rights, and advocating for more awareness and resources for mental health related issues. She founded the Committee on Mental Health and has made great strides in making new and improved free resources across the city. In addition to creating new centers where people can be treated or counseled, the Committee has also launched a new training program for volunteers who wish to help improve the awareness around mental health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any project or task that Paula takes on, she approaches with the same enthusiasm and energy. This is consistently seen in the results she produces, and she hopes to continue to serve Acquiaville as best she can for years to come.</p>\r\n"
