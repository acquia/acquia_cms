      value: "<p>Raghav Patel was elected in 2018 to represent District 2 of Acquiaville on the City Council. He has spent many years dedicated to public service and has been an active advocate for his community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to his election to City Council, Raghav founded a volunteer based organization, Feeding the World, where they made efforts every week to pick up unused perishable food products from restaurants and redistributed the meals to people in need. As City Council Member, he is currently a prominent member of the Committee to End Homelessness, as well as the Committee to Support Small Businesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raghav's passion outside of public service has always been cooking and learning about foods from different cultures. He spends his free time learning how to cook new cuisines, or taste testing Acquiaville's latest restaurants.&nbsp;A&nbsp;lot of this enthusiasm has translated into the efforts he has made to ensure that no one in the city goes hungry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
