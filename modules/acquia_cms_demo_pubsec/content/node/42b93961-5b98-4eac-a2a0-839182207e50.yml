      value: "<p>During this unprecedented&nbsp;time where much of the workforce and many schools have made the shift to be completely online, we have noticed a trend of innovation across the population. Students and workers alike&nbsp;have been trying&nbsp;to adapt and find new ways to celebrate milestones in their time apart from their friends. One of these major milestones that had the unfortunate timing of occurring during the quarantine was graduation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduations across high schools, colleges, even some elementary and middle school.&nbsp;Students everywhere were mourning their lost opportunity to celebrate as they reached the end of several long years of hard work. But wait! Was there a way for the students to still feel that sense of community? That sense of pride in a job well done? The celebration as they begin a major next step in their lives?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out the answer was yes! Schools everywhere found new and exciting ways to bring the celebration home to their students. Some created social media challenges, where students put on the graduation robes and tossed a diploma to a friend, who then proceeded to 'catch' it from their own homes. Some put up posters of every single graduating student out on the school's front lawn, so that each family could drive by and celebrate on graduation day, while&nbsp;still remaining safe and socially distant. Some went completely immersive and created virtual reality experiences! In addition to these, across the city, all schools&nbsp;proceeded with interactive virtual graduations, allowing the students to share their thoughts on this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this may not be the graduation these students imagined, it is one they will certainly never forget.</p>\r\n"
