      value: "<p>In most recent weather updates, experts have warned that a hurricane is headed towards Acquiaville within the next few days. According to the National Weather Center, we can expect the hurricane to last about 1-2 days. Here are some of the steps you can take to be prepared:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make a plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event of an evacuation in your neighborhood, you must be prepared. Make a plan with your family and decide where you will meet in the event you are separated. If you have pets, make sure you plan for their evacuation as well. Have a bag packed and ready with essentials for you and your family to take with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prepare for outages</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure to charge your phone and other essential electronics. Fill the gas in your car. If you have a generator, ensure it has enough fuel to be used for a power outage. Check the batteries in all your flashlights and keep any candles you may have handy to help light up the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pick up groceries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is always helpful to have enough food at home to weather out the storm, and avoid going outdoors. Check your local grocery store for canned goods or other non-perishables to have around. In the event of a power outage, it is also helpful to have food that will not need to be heated up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a more detailed list on how you can prepare for the hurricane, please check our website resources page.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
