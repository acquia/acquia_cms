      value: "<p>Outdoor dining used to be a filter you would apply to your restaurant search with fingers crossed that one would have a reservation open. Today, outdoor dining is the norm. Even the smallest of restaurants where you would struggle to stretch your legs out under the table, for fear of kicking the person opposite; where you would keep all your belongings - your purse, umbrella, coat - on your lap because there was simply nowhere to put it;&nbsp;all of these restaurants are now flourishing with the new possibilities of outdoor dining.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walk down the avenue blocks, every single restaurant and bar has not only taken over the sidewalks to include seating for their customers, but they have also taken over what used to be the parking spots in front of their establishments. Which makes one wonder why this pattern didn't exist before. Restaurants and bars have also taken amusing and creative measures to ensure that social distancing remains in place. One bar had their live musicians seated inside the bar with the window open, while all the customers sat outside and enjoyed the live music. Another has chosen to project the latest ball game on to the wall of their building so customers can still get the experience of their local sports bar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In enjoying these new outdoor experiences as we struggle to bring our lives back to normal, it is important to remember that the people maintaining these experiences are at risk every day. Do your part, be respectful, and maintain social distancing. And please! Tip well!</p>\r\n"
