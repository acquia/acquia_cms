        <h2><a name="authoring">Authoring Content</a></h2>
        <p>ACMS comes with default structured and unstructured content types. The structured content types are -</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Places</li>
          <li>People</li>
          <li>Events</li>
          <li>Articles</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Unstructured content types are -</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pages</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>You can use the pages content type to create any of the landing pages. The pages content type allows you to
          use the various Site Studio components and create landing pages as you like.
        </p>
        <p>The content types follow the out of the box content authoring experience. All you need to do is head over to
          the node/add screen and follow the links. For more detailed information please refer to the user guide.

        <h2><a name="editing">Editing and Publishing Content</a></h2>
        <p>ACMS comes with a pre-configured content lifecycle. An article or event (or any content type) begins with a
          draft state, moves to in review and finally gets published. Once you feel you no longer need the content for
          the site visitor you can move it to archive, which will unpublish the content from the site. Only content with
          state published is visible to site visitors. All other states are only visible to users with appropriate
          content permissions.
        </p>
        <p class="error">Please note the current workflow within ACMS is only set up for content types.</p>

        <p>In ACMS, menu management is unchanged and follows the core Drupal workflow.
          Menus can be managed at /admin/structure/menu.
        </p>
        <p>ACMS comes pre-configured with header and footer menus.
          The menu that you see in the header of the site after installation is named as Main Navigation.
          You can access the menu admin/structure/menu/manage/main.
          Once you are on the page you can add/edit/delete and manage the links shown in the header

        <p>Similar to the header menu, the footer menu also comes pre-configured with ACMS.
          The footer menu is displayed on the site in the footer region.
          You can access the menu admin/structure/menu/manage/footer.
          Once you are on the page you can add/edit/delete and manage the links shown in the footer

        <h2><a name="forms">Creating Forms</a></h2>
        <p>Acquia CMS includes the Webform module to enable site builders to create forms through the administrative UI.
          We include one sample form in our public sector demo (‘Contact Us’ in the main menu)
          as an implementation example.
        </p>
        <p>There is extensive documentation on working with webforms on Drupal.org. Some key reference materials are:</p>

        <h2><a name="site-studio">Working with Site Studio</a></h2>
        <p>ACMS is opinionated and integrated with other Acquia products out of the box.
          With the current version it comes pre-configured with Acquia Site Studio and has pre-built components.
        </p>
        <p>When you install ACMS and set up your Acquia Site Studio keys, you get the following components
          out of the box which will help you to get started with your site building right after installation.
        </p>
        <p>To use these components all you need to do is start creating page type of content.
          To do so head over to node/add/page
