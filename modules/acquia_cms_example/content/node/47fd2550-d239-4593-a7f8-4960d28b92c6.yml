      value: "<p>It's a bird! It's a plane!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No! It's the Acquiaville Hot Air Balloon Festival!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acquiaville celebrated its 12th annual hot air balloon festival today, and this reporter was lucky enough to be a part of the festivities. The festival began at 5am at an airport hangar outside of the city. Breakfast was served buffet style, with an assortment of pancakes, waffles, bacon and eggs. And of course, coffee, because why else would anyone wait in line at 5am in the morning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After caffeinating up, we trudged out on to the field to a mass of deflated colors. Balloon owners were hard at work getting set up to fill their balloons, while their teams hustled around the field to try and sell tickets to festival goers to take a ride up in one. One by one, balloons inflated to show their vibrant designs and humorous shapes. One shaped like an elephant, another shaped like a giant duck. What started out as an open field soon became a maze of enormous baskets and balloons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, we watched these hot air balloons begin to take flight. Much to the dismay of the local avian population, the sky was suddenly filled with pinks and greens and yellows and people screaming to their friends down below about how insane the view was. It seemed like there was a common route among them because they would all fly west for the same duration and disappear behind the same set of trees. It was truly a sight to see, and if you have never been to one of these before, there is always next year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
