This file explains how to get set up as an Acquia developer, working on Acquia CMS itself. It does not cover how to install Acquia CMS and build a site with it.

### Assumptions
These instructions assume that you have an Acquia Cloud account, and that you are using a nix-type command line environment (e.g. Linux, macOS, or the Windows 10 subsystem for Linux).

You should also have:
* PHP 7.3 or later installed. (`php --version`)
* An invitation to the Acquia Engineering subscription in Acquia Cloud. Your manager or technical architect should be able to get you an invitation to this subscription if you need one.
* A GitHub account which is authorized within the Acquia organization and can access https://github.com/acquia/acquia_cms.

### Background
To provide a consistent environment for our development team, Acquia CMS is developed using Acquia's Cloud IDE service, which provides a VSCode-like developer experience. It is possible to work on Acquia CMS on your own machine, using your IDE of choice, but this file doesn't cover that.

### Setting up Cloud IDE
Because there is a limited number of Cloud IDEs available to the Acquia CMS team, each active developer should only need (and have) one. Therefore, you should only do this once.

1. Visit https://github.com/acquia/cli#installation and follow the instructions to get the Acquia CLI tool installed. For example:
```
curl -OL https://github.com/acquia/cli/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta1/acli.phar
sudo mv acli.phar /usr/local/bin/acli
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/acli
acli --version
# You should see a version here. If not, be sure that /usr/local/bin is in your PATH.
```
2. Run `acli auth:login` and follow the prompts. You will need to log in to your Acquia Cloud account and create a new API key and token, which you should save in a safe place. (You'll need them later.)
3. Run `acli ide:create` and you will get a list of subscriptions to which you have access. You should see "Acquia Engineering" in there somewhere; enter the number for that one. If you are asked to link the cloud application to a repository, say "no". Enter a personally identifying label for your IDE, like "phenaproxima Acquia CMS".
4. Wait 5 to 10 minutes while DNS propagates; go play with a puppy or have a cup of coffee. When propagation is done, you will see the URLs for your IDE and the Drupal site it is linked to, respectively. (Depending on your ISP and location, the CLI tool can time out while waiting for DNS propagation. If you encounter an error, try switching to an alternative DNS server. See https://docs.acquia.com/dev-studio/ide/known-issues/#creating-a-remote-ide-may-time-out-due-to-dns-propagation for more information. Don't worry -- your IDE is still being provisioned and will be accessible. Just run `acli ide:list` to see the IDEs in the subscription, which will include the URLs.)
5. Run `acli ide:open`. Choose the "Acquia Engineering" subscription, and the IDE you just created. It should open in your browser and you should see a "getting started" page.
6. Click the "Setup ADS CLI" button and follow the prompts. You'll need to enter the API key and token you created in step 2.
7. Click the "Generate SSH key" button. When asked for a password, enter one that you can remember. When asked if you want to upload the SSH key to Acquia Cloud, say yes. Label your SSH key similarly to how you labeled the IDE, e.g. `phenaproxima_AcquiaCMS`, and upload it to Acquia Cloud. When prompted for the passphrase, enter the password you just created.
8. Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Copy the SSH key and add it to your GitHub account. See https://docs.acquia.com/dev-studio/ide/start/#cloning-your-application-from-a-github-repository-to-your-ide for more information. Be sure to enable SSO for the newly added key, authorizing the Acquia organization.
9. In the Cloud IDE's terminal, clone the Acquia CMS Git repository: `git clone git@github.com:acquia/acquia_cms.git ~/project --branch develop`
10. Install all dependencies:
```
cd project
composer install
composer run post-install-cmd
```
10. Install Drupal: `drush site:install acquia_cms --yes --account-pass admin`
11. In the "Open Drupal Site" menu, choose "Open site in a new tab" and ensure you can see the Drupal site, and log in with the username "admin" and password "admin".
